# About
This directory contains the FHIR schema files. They are not meant to be edited.

## JSON Schema support
FHIR R4, and R5 (from 2/22/2022), JSON Schema files are placed under this directory to be used as needed. One use of these files is a Visual Studio Code configuration to provide auto commpletion and validation of JSON FHIR resouces under an IG, or under the `examples` folder. These schema files have been slightly changed from their originals to address few minor issues, and to add an `Example` subschema. I will document this further at some ponit.
