[This Bundle](https://github.com/phenopackets/vulcan/blob/main/fw-ig/drafting-r401/input/examples/Bundle-ptb-1.xml) is meant to capture the [PhenoTips sample data](https://github.com/phenopackets/vulcan/tree/main/data/phenotips-outputs) and show validation results according to the base FHIR R4 specification and the [GA4GH Phenopacket (version 2) FHIR Implementation Guide](http://phenopackets.org/core-ig/).  It currently only has a copy of [DevelopmentalDely example of the Phenopacket Composition profile listed here](http://phenopackets.org/core-ig/StructureDefinition-Phenopacket-examples.html) as a starting point and a placeholder to be replaced by the information from the PhenoTips data files.

See [this issue](https://github.com/phenopackets/vulcan/issues/1) for discussions related to this example.

The following table is the validation output for the Bundle.
